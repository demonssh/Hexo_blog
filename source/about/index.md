## About Me
---
Hi, I'm Junzhe Li — an engineer focused on distributed systems, backend, system design, embedded systems, and performance.

## Education
---
- Carnegie Mellon University — M.S. Computer Engineering (2024–2025, Pittsburgh, PA)
- University at Buffalo, SUNY — B.S. Computer Engineering (2020–2024, Buffalo, NY)

## Skills
---
- Languages: C++, C, Java, Python, Bash, SQL, Linux
- Backend & System Design: REST/gRPC services, caching, schema design, reliability, performance tuning
- Distributed Systems: Kafka, messaging, replication, telemetry pipelines
- Embedded & Systems: ARM/C/ASM, drivers, MMU, threading, RT performance
- Observability & Perf: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, load testing
- Data/Storage: PostgreSQL, Redis, TimescaleDB, Parquet, S3, SQLite, FAISS

## Experience (highlights)
---
- AWS — Software Engineering Intern (May–Aug 2025, Seattle, WA): Built developer productivity tooling for EC2 networking; added latency/throughput gates; integrated Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger; traffic simulators at 100+ Gbps; canaries/rollbacks with Argo Rollouts; Docker/K8s/Helm; Redis/PostgreSQL with replicas; CloudFormation for repeatable environments.
- Clarkson University — Research Assistant (May 2023–Feb 2024, Potsdam, NY): Scalable compute pipeline in C++/Python; queued scheduling, batching, checkpointing; Parquet + PostgreSQL layout; CI with GitHub Actions; pytest/CTest/GTest; metrics with Prometheus; reproducible Docker environments.

## Projects (sample)
---
- Distributed telemetry data platform for satellite ground stations: streaming ingestion, replication, time-series indexing; async batching, zero-copy buffer reuse; Kafka + ClickHouse; p99 latency < 200 ms.
- ARM-based OS development: custom bootloader/kernel (C/ASM), scheduling, MMU, drivers; optimized threading and syscalls; CI/CD regressions.
- WayFinder BLE indoor localization: triangulation + phase angle; Raspberry Pi + Python OpenCV pipeline; improved accuracy and responsiveness.
